<h3 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to my website!</h3>


You will find here a description of my projects and research activities.

I develop innovative imaging techniques to probe highly heterogeneous materials based on measurements of scattered waves. 

To achieve this, I establish mathematical models describing the behavior of waves in complex environments that may cause resonances and nonlinear phenomena.

Finally, I design software that integrates my results, thus allowing validation and online accessibility.
